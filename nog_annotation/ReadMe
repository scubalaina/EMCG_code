Scripts to annotate, parse, and tally proteins hits to EggNOG (NOG) HMM profiles (v5).
NOG HMM profiles were combined from bacteria, archaea, eukarya, and viruses.


Initial HMM search run via NextFlow: 1_nog_hmmsearch.nf (with a nextflow.config file)
Command within NextFlow script run on each SAG individually with a maximum E value of 10^-5:
hmmsearch -E 0.00001 --tblout ${SAG}_hmm_tbl.txt nog.hmm ${faa}
HMM table outputs (_hmm_tbl.txt) are placed in a single directory.


Parsing was completed in two steps for efficiency due to large size of outputs.
Parsing: parse_nog_hmmtbl.py
Each _hmm_tbl.txt table is filtered for a protein's best hit to the NOG HMM profiles based on highest bitscore.
Output files (_nog_parsed.tsv) for each SAG are placed in a single directory.

Joining: join_nog_parsed.py
Concatenates each _nog_parsed.tsv table from each SAG into a single file. Two files are produced. One with all hits ({dataset_label}_nog_parsed.tsv) and one with a minimum bitscore of 30 (({dataset_label}_nog_parsed_min30bit.tsv), a threshold determiend by Roux et al 2017 PeerJ.

Tallying domain hits: tally_dom_hits.py
Generates a tab-seperated table with each row corresponding to a SAG and the columns corresponding to a taxon/entity or group (e.g. "cellular_hits".
The "cellular_hits" column is used to calculate the proprotion of cellular genes in the SAG later used to determine whether the SAG is cellular or viral
